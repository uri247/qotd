# QOTD

## fork
This repository is a fork from Bastia Rieck SimpleServer project. This fork contains some file renaming (cc => cpp)
which reflects my personal taste, and some minimal changes.

Original project: https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/SimpleServer

Also, the project is containerized. The build process creates a docker container and pushes it to docker hub (as a 
separate target).

## Licence

The code is released under an MIT licence, which was the license of the original project.
